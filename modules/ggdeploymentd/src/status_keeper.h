//! Single-slot persistence for the latest undelivered IoT Jobs status update.
//!
//! ggdeploymentd reports deployment status (IN_PROGRESS / SUCCEEDED / FAILED)
//! to IoT Jobs with a single fire-and-forget publish. If that publish fails
//! (flaky network, reboot mid-outage) the update is lost and the cloud-side job
//! is left stale. This module persists the pending status to ggconfigd so it
//! can be re-sent once connectivity returns or after a restart.
//!
//! Greengrass nucleus lite only tracks one deployment at a time ($next), so a
//! single slot is stored at config `services/DeploymentService/pendingStatus`
//! and replaced in place -- this is intentionally NOT a queue.
//!
//! Pure storage: this module persists / reads / clears the slot. Flush
//! orchestration (deciding when to re-send) lives in iot_jobs_listener.c.
//!
//! Thread-safe: config-slot operations are serialized by an internal mutex,
//! while the cached pending hint is accessed atomically.
